mozdef-private-scl3

private repo for the scl3 QA deployment of mozdef

This repo will be used to make updates to the QA MozDef system in SCL3. Primarily for testing new alerts and logging.

Only .py, .ini, .conf, and .sh files are added with the exception of the GeoLiteCity.dat file. I figure this would be a good way to update that file as needed, until we create an automated way to do it.
